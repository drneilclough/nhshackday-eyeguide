## KEY ADVICE
1. Rule out acute stoke - forehead will be spared in stroke.  UMN Vs LMN involvement
2. Examine carefully and discuss/investigate futher if not clearly Bells. Be aware of differential diagnoses eg:
* Stroke (UMN weakness, other signs) 
* Peripheral space occupying lesions eg parotid mass (other cranial nerve involvement eg. hearing loss)
* Vasculitidies (systemic symptoms)
* Zoster (look in ear for vesicles)
* Mastoiditis (painful, pt unwell)


2. Bells palsy usually spontaneously recovers over 3 months
3. Problems: Corneal exposure, lacrimal pump failure, facial asymmetry, upper lid retraction


## Examination

*    Check all other cranial nerves carefully.
Always test corneal sensation, Bells reflex and upgaze. 
*    Check ear for vesicles. If present, then likely herpes zoster/Ramsey-Hunt, could be treated with PO aciclovir or valaciclovir.  To be decided by medics/ENT 
*   Measure and document lagophthalmos 

## Managment


**Systemic**

Discuss wth medics and/or ENT.  Usual treatment is:
* If no other cause found, 50mg po prednisolone for 1 week + PPI cover 
* **Bells palsy is not treated with antiviral medication, but** 
If patient has zoster related facial palsy and NOT Bells palsy then treat with aciclovir or valaciclovir eg:
        Aciclovir 400mg 5x/day for 7 days
        OR
        Valaciclovir 1g 3x/day for 7 days


**Ophthalmic**

*    Lubricants: eg hylotears 2hrly, vitaPOS nocte
*    Lid taping: Upper lid at night to close eye, and/or thin strip under lower lid to lift/tighten during the day

**Follow-up** 

* If no keratitis then book follow-up in genenral clinic in 1 month
* If keratitis present then refer to corneal and adnexal team urgently and consider external lid weight (located in adnexal trolley) as temporising measure
