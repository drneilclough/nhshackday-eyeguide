## KEY ADVICE
Corneal protection is main concern, there is a risk of sight threatening keratitis if not managed well

**Managment**
* Regular lubricants +/- chloramphenicol PF
* Consider lid taping
* Consider large diameter contact lens if no sign of keratitis
* Etropion secondary to over-riding of anterior lamellar can be treated temporarily with 20iu of Dysport

Patients should be referred to adnexal team.  Urgency depends on extent of corneal involvement.  If keratitis present then consider urgent surgery
