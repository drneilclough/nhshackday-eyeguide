## KEY ADVICE 

**1.  MUST DOCUMENT Full Ophthalmic assessment for confirmation of diagnosis, monitoring and severity:**
a. Take a photo of patient using their own      phone  to monitor degree of swelling (front and side view)
b. Measure proptosis ( exothalmometry + instrument used i.e oculus)	
c. Optic nerve function assessment:

    * Vision
    * Colour vision (red desat and/or Ishihara)
    * RAPD (or reverse RAPD if unable visualise)
    * Extraocular movement ( true restriction or due to pain?)
    * Optic disc: swelling, pale, pink, haemorrhage, CWS
    * Confrontational Visual field if possible
    * Nasal symptoms: URTI, rhinorrhea, congestion, sinusitis
   
2. Past medical history of : 
a. Sinus problems
b. Recent head injury/ orbital fractures
c. Immunocompromise / diabetes
d. IVDU or recent hospital admissions
e. conjunctival swab ( viral/micro)


3.	**BE AWARE OF NECROTISING FASCIITIS AND CEREBRAL ABCESS IN VERY SICK OR CONFUSED PATIENTS**

4.	ALWAYS SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISING CONSULTANT AT THIS POINT
