## KEY ADVICE 

1.  Early and good quality irrigation is paramount and will affect the final outcome.  Treat before vision testing. 
2.  Alkali burns are more destructive than acid eg ammonia, drain cleaner, lime in wet plaster, cement, mortar. 
3.  Check on toxbase if unsure of agent
4.  Document details & timing of injury, extent of exposure and measures already taken.
5.  Document: Vision, facial skin involvement and IOP. Specifically document examination of: 
* lids (may be burned, oedematous) 
* conjunctiva (staining extent, chemosis, haemorrhage)
* Presence and % extent of limbal ischaemia (prognostic)
* Cornea (clarity, size of epi defect, **BEWARE** total epithelial defect may be mistaken for normal cornea as may not take up fluoerscein)
* A/C depth and if inflammation present
* Lens opacity
* Fundus exam
6. Limbal ischaemia may not be present immediately, any patient with moderate to severe burn should be followed up next day




 ## MANAGEMENT 

 
 ### _IMMEDIATE_ 
 
1. Check pH both eyes (normal 7.3 - 7.6)  
*Do not delay irrigation if cannot find litmus paper immediately*
3. Topical analgesia and irrigation (may need speculum), 2L normal saline.  Use plastic IV giving set tubing to allow for more controlled flow.
4. Check pH 5 min after stopping irrigation 
*   If normal recheck pH every 15 mins for 1 hour to ensure no retained material
* If abnormal after irrigation repeat with 2L NaCl and re-examine, consider double eversion of lids and sweeping fornix with cotton bud
4. Continue irrigating until normal pH.  If pH persistently abnormal look again for retained matter
5. Grade extent of damage

### Ongoing treatment
Treatement depends on severity of burn.  
Corneal consultant/fellow should be made aware of all moderate/severe burns

**Minor:**
* g PF chloramphenicol drops qds 1/52
* g PF lubricating drops 1-2 hrly + liquid paraffin nocte
* Follow-up depends on level of concern. Usually review in a few days. 

**Moderate/Severe:**
* g PF chloramphenicol drops qds 1/52
* g PF cyclopentolate 1% tds 1/52
* g PF dexamethasone 0.1% 1-2 hrly
* g potassium ascorbate drops 10% 1-2 hrly
* g citrate drops 10% 1-2 hrly
* Oral doxycycline 100mg bd (note CI below)
* Oral ascorbate 1g bd
* If raised IOP use acetazolomide, avoid drops if possible
* Arrange next day review.  Severe and/or bilateral burns consider admission to help with drop regimen


 *Doxycycline contraindications:*
 Children <12yrs, pregnant/breastfeeding, hepatic/renal impaiment
