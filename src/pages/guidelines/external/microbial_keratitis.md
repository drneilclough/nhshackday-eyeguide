## KEY ADVICE 

1.  Suspect infection in all contact lens wearers
2.  Most common pathogen is pseudomonas.
3.  Ask about contact lens wear:type, duration, worn to sleep, shower, swim, contact with stagnant freshwater(amoeba)
4.  Contact lens wearer + dentrites = acanthomoeba until proven otherwise (**Do not** assume its HSK)
5.  Do not start steroid treatment in supected infection without senior advice.
6.  Unusual presentations or unresponsive to treatment be suspicious of fungal or acanthomoeba. (see section on fungal/ acanthomoeba keratitis)
     

 ## MANAGEMENT 

 
 ### _IMMEDIATE_ 
 
1. Document size of epithelial defect ( the area uptaing stain, NOT  the area of infiltrate)Any fibrin/ hypopyon/ AC activity
3. Send off contact lens if available for microbiology
4. Corenal scrape any ulcer > 1mm
5. Steps in Corneal scrape:
* Topical anaesthetic
* Organge needles x 5 (new needle for every plate)
* Corneal plates ( in packs in treatment room fridge)
    * Glass slide (gram stain)
    * Blood agar (aerobes + anaerobes)
    * Sabaurounds agar ( fungi) if suspect fungus-PCR
    * Brain-heart infusion broth (fungi + aerobes)
* label all plates correctly
* Request on CERNER microbiology forms, print out request form and send plates to CUH pathology.
* Documentation **AFTER** scraping
    * Size of epithelial defect post-scraping
    * area and depth of thinning if any
    * size of infiltrate
    * any fibirn/ hypopyon

6. Treatment:
    * g. Moxivig hourly day + night for 48 hours then taper accordingly.
    * g. Cyclopentolate 1% BD in patient with AC reaction
    

 ### _Scrape Results_ 
 
1.  Gram stain and micropsy should be ready in few hours, phone lab for results if needed.
2.  Cultures- after 48 hrs - Check on CERNER

 ### _FOLLOW-UP_
 
 1. Review in Rapid Access Clinic at 48 hours 
 (email: moorfields.croydonurgentcare@nhs.net)
 3. If epithelial defect resolved - taper to 6xday for 1 week and discharge
 4. If improving but still have defect - refer for review in General clinic/ PCC via email.
 5. If no improvement or worsening in symptoms and signs - Contact Corneal consultant / Fellow Urgently (email: nicola.lau@nhs.net)
 6. If Large corneal abscess / assoicated with performation / leak / melt - contact Corneal consultant same day.  May require transfer to SGH ( See corneal admission page for guidance on transfer )

 ## CAUTION 
 
1. Most cases improve within 48 hours, at least pain will improve.
2. Suscisious of fungal if
    * trauma with plant material
    * immunocompromised/ diabetes
    * very white abscess with stromal/endothelial progression
3. Suspicious of acanthomoeba if
    * Pain disporportion to epithelial defect
    * Poor contact lens hygiene
    * "looks like HSK / disciform keratits"
    * Prominent corneal nerves
    * Microcysts
