## KEY ADVICE 
**1. Mechanism:** 
- Primary or secondary? Primary (90%) = pupil block or peripheral iris crowding. Secondary (10%) = lens induced, causes behind lens
 - If suspect secondary causes eg lens, aqueous misdirection, choroidals, etc, lower IOP, but DISCUSS WITH GLAUCOMA CONSULTANT before using pilocarpine 
 - ? Pupil block present: Peripheral iris usually flattens on indentation gonioscopy in pupil block PACG.  If pupil block present but AC is asymmetrically   shallow centrally, consider secondary causes 


**2.	All PACG should have bilateral PIs before leaving dept** 

**3.	Arrange follow-up at 7 days**
 ## MANAGEMENT 
 ### _IMMEDIATE_ 
 
1. Diamox 500mg IV (if acute + symptoms)
2. Pilocarpine 2%, 4% dark irides (note contraindications above) 
3. Timolol 0.25% (check contraindications: asthma, heartblock)
4. Iopidine 0.5%
5. Pred forte 1%
6. Lie patient supine 
7. Analgesia/antiemetics 

 ### _REASSESS @ 60 MIN_ 
 
1.  IOP still elevated: 
* Consider indenting central cornea gently with 4 mirror lens or moistened cotton bud. 2â€“3 cycles of 30s on/off 
* D/W glaucoma or urgent care consultant regarding further management

2.	IOP reduced: 
* Bilateral PIs, then if IOP controlled, discharge on:
- [ ] Pilocarpine 2% qid (4% dark irides)
- [ ] Apraclonidine 0.5% tid
- [ ] Pred forte 1% 2-hourly, qid in fellow eye 
- [ ] Acetazolamide PO 250mg qid, (omit if IOP <10mm HG)
   
* Book follow-up 7 days glaucoma clinic. Notify consultant of patient.
 
 ## CAUTION 
 
**All urgent care cases should be D/W the allocated urgent care consultant of the day (listed on rota)**



**Acetazolomide:**
* Careful use of in elderly &/or small patients
* Check contraindications
* Explain likely SEs, and what to do if concerned

**Pilocarpine:**
* Do not use intensively
* May be ineffective if IOP>50, can also cause paradoxical A/C shallowing and worsen pupil block if used intensively
