## KEY ADVICE 

1.  Is it definitely only anterior?
  a. **Always dilate!**
  b. No fundal view - B-scan to rule out endophthalmitis / posterior uveitis / posterior scleritis etc
  c. Is there a hypopyon?
  

2. Primary or secondary causes? 
  a. Primary: 
    *   Idiopathic
    *   HLA-B27 related ( ask AS sympotms)
    *   Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis

   b. Secondary:
    *   Consider corneal pathology- ulcer/ HSK / HZV
    *   Endophthalmitis/ retinitis

**Consider serious causes if mutton fat / stellate KPs, Hypopyon, hx of surgery, injury**


 ## MANAGEMENT 

 
 ### _Principle_ 
 
1. Manage the Inflammation
2. Manage the pressure
3. Induce dilation to break posterior synichiae
4. Do you need to consider subconj injection?

 ### _Treatment_ 
 
1.  Inflammation: 
a. Dexamethasone drop 1% hourly 2 days then 6x/day for 1 week
b. In simple cases taper above over 6 weeks

2. Dilation:
a. cycloplentolate 1% BD for at least first week

4. IOP  
a. Use B-blocker, topical calcium channel blocker ( brinzolamide) first
b. Oral diamox if required
c. Avoid Alpha-agonists ( pro-inflammatory)
d. Avoid Prostaglandin, but if already on prostaglandin for glaucoma no need to stop.

4. Subconjunctival injection:
a. for severe cases
b. 1ml subconj mydricaine ( need to check)

5. Book follow-up:
    a. If simple AAU or known recurrent - PCC or Uveitis 6-8 weeks
    b. If IOP high- review 1 week for IOP check in PCC
    c. If severe - discuss with duty consultant / uveitis team.  Email Mr Will Tucker Uveitis consultant at : william.tucker@nhs.net
    
  
 
 ## CAUTION 
 
**All severe or paediatric cases should be discussed with the allocated Rapid Access clinic consultant of the day (listed on rota)**


1.	Acetazolomide: 
a.	Careful use of in elderly &/or small patients
b.	Check contraindications
c.	Explain likely SEs, and what to do if concerned

2.	Children with anterior uveitis: 
a.	Can be minimal or asymptomatic
b.  Steroids can induce very high pressure in kids
c.  Be aware of JIA - discuss with paediatric consultant with considering f/u
