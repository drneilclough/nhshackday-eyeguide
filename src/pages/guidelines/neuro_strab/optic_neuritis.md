Excessive pain
Rapid and excessive vision loss (<48hrs, <CF vision)
Disc hges
Bilateral simultaneous involvement

**Atypical Causes:**
* NMO - NOTE can appear similar to typical  
* Optic neuropathy
    * Compressive - eg. tumours 
    * Inflammatory - *eg. sarcoid, autoimmune disease*
    * Ischaemic - *eg. AION, NAION*

## Managment:
### Typical Optic Neuritis
* If first presentation order
    * Bloods: FBC, U+E, LFT, ESR, CRP, uric acid, ACE, ANA, VDRL
    * MRI brain + orbits 2-4/52
 
* All patients to be offered oral steroids (1g methypred od 3/7 + PPI). 
    * Explain to pt, steroids offer better visual outcome at 6 months (the benefit disappears at 2 years), and lower risk of recurrence long term  
* New patients D/W on call neurology cons and arrange neuro-ophth follow-up in 2 weeks
* Discuss all patients with ophthalmology consulant

### Atypical Optic Neuritis
* D/W consultant if any suspicion of atypical optic neuritis
* Treatment depends on underlying cause
* Pt suspected on NMO should be admitted under neurology for IVMP
